Si début d'anecdote, interroger dessus !


* Questionnaire 1 : 1: 2017 2: 0 3: depends on festival, last one i went to was roskilde and it lasts 7 days. 4: Dont rly hang much with crew people but always been nice from my exp. 5: Was at a small festival in sweden and my whole camp got ravaged by some kinda bug that left nasty musquito bites. Think it was some kinda lice, horrible experiance. On the other side of the coin gettin to see C2C, nine inch nails, coldplay, blink-182 and many others makes it all worth it. 6: Well its about the same but you speak english, think most festivals people are just open chill and having a good time. 7: Not sure prob my latest one since i went with most of my rl mates who i knew from way back when, was kinda a goodbye festival, most moved away from sweden, me included. 8: Look at 5. Honestly imo best part about music festivals (apart from getting to enjoy bands/artists live) is the people, its 99% of my experiance very open and chill everyones welcome to just hang out in any camp and have a good time.
* * Questionnaire 2 : 1) my last one was uuuugh over 2 years ago? tomorrowland which originally got postponed due to covid 2) didn’t attend any past 2 years but usually 5-8, with some small local festivals too during summer 3) the ones i attend either 3 days, or 1 if it’s local 4) well im more than satisfied if we talking big, like tomorrowland/defqon/ultra. i mostly went alone and im paranoid enough but i did felt safe. even tho i know they’re not checking tomorrowland for drugs and stuff so its rather easy to carry shit inside but overall organizing was good with good security around. it does get fucked sometimes due to weather or people being disrespectful to others (like in tomorrowland i usually stay over there with the tent camping and it’s usually impossible to get a normal sleep because yeah, people scream and party all 3 days) 5) probably tomorrowland and lost lands. tomorrowland due to it being something magical and having a good line ups every year, they have a really sick decorations every year (the anniversary one they had was INSANE, u could even pay up inside to join a little celebration with cake and shit) lost lands is kind of personal for me due to being organized by one of my favorite artist and i’m very happy and proud of him overall so seeing it pop every year just makes me happy and i recommend it to all my friends who likes heavy music and good atmosphere 6) yeah majority of fests i was attending was held in another country but to be honest, i didn’t have any issues since 90% of people there speak english and ready to help if anything. there’s always a group of people who are ready to help new comers and if u happen to be in their group, they watch over you and guide you around 7) tomorrowland! i think it kinda lines up with what i said earlier, but if i come to think of it, its not even the festival but people and atmosphere you’re in that makes you feel magical and carries away for all 3 days that you're there. tomorrowland was my first fest i ever attended, i remember being giga nervous about it, speaking with people in discord and organizing group of people who want to stick and camp together. and even after all 3 days of drinking, smoking , dancing and having no sleep you feel so alive and happy. one of my friends unironically had past festival syndrome where he just rewatched videos on repeat bcos he missed it so much 8) i guess im lucky enough not to have any bad memories or experiences with it. i can only speak from aside, i know people who got their belongings stolen, or their tents being completely fucked by other people but personally i’m lucky enough to now encounter any of that haha i also have a little story, when i attended tomorrowland 3-4 years back, i originally planned to do with a friend of mine but he kinda knocked me over last minute. and he was supposed to carry pillows and blanket for both of us (because we camp there and it’s just too much for me to carry tent+pillows+everything else) so when i came there i was giga upset bcos i didn’t know how im gonna proceed in empty tent and it was rather cold that summer and it was raining a lot but some people helped me around and shared stuff with me and i ended up camping with them for all 3 days!


* Questionnaire 3: -When was the last time you went to a festival ? It was in 2019 before corona happened. -How often do you go to festivals per year ? i used to go to 1 or 2 national festivals each year. 1st was a mix between local and national festival, and it lasts 3 days fri-sun. 2nd was a 1 day festival, where it travels around the country. This one is called (grøn koncert, which means green concert) -How many days do you spend in the same festival per average ? Most festivals in Denmark are 3 days, where the campus/living area opens up a few days earlier than the music starts. -How was the organisation of the festivals you've went to in general ( if u have any anecdote tell it ) The festivals ive been to has always been very well organized.. The music inputs starts on time, all the booths never run out of what they are selling. So not much to say here. -How was the festival that marked you the most and why ? ( either in a good or bad way ) It was an amazing festival. It was my 2nd festival ever probably in like 2010 or 2011. The year before it had rained alot so i went home already on day 1. So this year the weather was amazing and everything just lined up good. I went with other people than the year prior. The music was great and overall i just had a really good time. That one year probably is the reason i went for so many years. -In case you went a festival in a foreign country, was it the same experience or it was different ( explain how if it was different, if u had any difficulties ) Sadly i haven't. Always wanted to try it, but it just never alligned up with friends being able to go and im not ready to take the leap of faith and go solo. -What was your best experience of a festival and why ? Me and 5 other friends went to go hear the music of a local danish artist. Before the show started we all wrote a letter on our bodies. Both on the front and the back. We then made sure to be there early, so we could stand front row. When the show started.. He noticed us, said thank you and even went down from the stage to give each of us a handshake as gratitude. -What was your worst experience of a festival and why ? One year at the local festival (Jelling musik festival) i was living at the campus area, and while i was moving some alcohol to the area where we would stay, via a wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow got stuck so i crushed my big toe into its wheels. So i had to go to the infermary. At the infermary i got a vaccine against tetanus. I basically managed to get a pretty severe injury in the first 15 minutes of the festival. Luckily for me it wasn't more serious than i could stay at the festival.
* Questionnaire 4: -When was the last time you went to a festival ? -> August / Waldfrieden Wonderland -How often do you go to festivals per year ? -> maybe once a year if I feel like it -How many days do you spend in the same festival per average ? -> depends how long the festival lasts (last was 3 days) -How was the organisation of the festivals you've went to in general ( if u have any anecdote tell it ) -> I cannot complain, most was well organized, only bad thing was that toilets were dirty all the time, showers were filled with mud, garbage and so on so not really enjoyable (better cleaning personnel would have been nice) -In case you went a festival in a foreign country, was it the same experience or it was different ( explain how if it was different, if u had any difficulties ) -> never went to a festival in a foreign country -What was your best experience of a festival and why ? -> not the festival in general, because the ones i pick are always great. but its the atmosphere, going there with friends, chilling, hanging out, just having a good time together and vibing to the music -What was your worst experience of a festival and why ? -> one of the worst things that can happen to me on a festival is when the weather is not what u expected it to be. like when it rains the entire time it just kills the mood. everything is muddy, its wet and i kinda get pissed then


Questionnaire 5: -When was the last time you went to a festival ? πAround 2018 iirc, pre covid. Gone to some concerts after that but no festivals. -How often do you go to festivals per year ? πDepends what bands are playing and what works out with schedule etc, but if everything aligns I'd go 1-2 times a year. -How many days do you spend in the same festival per average ? π1-2 days usually -How was the organisation of the festivals you've went to in general ( if u have any anecdote tell it ) πmain issues I vaguely remember has been around drinking areas + toilets, either too organized (annoying) or very sloppy (ends up disgusting). Hard to find a middle ground I guess. -How was the festival that marked you the most and why ? ( either in a good or bad way ) π hmm well as long as everything works what makes something special is the people around you, not the festival itself imo. -In case you went a festival in a foreign country, was it the same experience or it was different ( explain how if it was different, if u had any difficulties ) πdid not -What was your best experience of a festival and why ? π just hanging around with the friends at that time and having a blast listening to the music we love -What was your worst experience of a festival and why ? π idk if it's a specific memory or a general pattern, but poorly organized areas for food/drink etc is pretty annoying. Important that the queues for things don't "leak out" into other areas making it difficult to move around etc.
